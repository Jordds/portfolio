    my 4th semester at Fontys was my specialisation. I chose for AI out of interest in the subject. You hear a lot about it, and I wanted to learn a more about it. The subject in the semester was machine learning and applying ML algorithms to data. We got taught us a methodology when going through ML projects. It is about more then just building applying an algorithm.
